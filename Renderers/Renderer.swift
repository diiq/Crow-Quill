 A Renderer is something that gets handed to a drawable and produces an image.

 That image can be any type at all; for tests our 'images' are arrays of strings.
 This protocol is a complete listing of all drawing methods necessary to render
 an image. These should remain backwards-compatible, so that existing images can
 still be opened and re-rendered.

 Be sure to check out [the WWDC talk](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2015-408/)
 that inspired this rendering architecture.
